#  theStack01.py     Some silly functions that help show how the stack works
#  P. Conrad for CS8, Fall 2010, UCSB CS Dept.

# The functions in this file aren't intended to do useful work.
# Instead, they are here to help us look at how function calls actually
# work---what happens inside the computer when a function is called.

# We'll look at this example first, and then apply what we've learned
# to situations involving useful programs.
